# 4th Down Statistics

How often do coaches go for it when they should?

```{r warning = FALSE}
p <- ggplot(data = fourth_decisions, aes(x = should_go)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, fill = "#69b3a2", color="#e9ecef") +

  ggtitle("When NFL Coaches Don't Go When They Shouldn't") +
  xlab("")

grid.arrange(p, p1, ncol = 1)
