# Data

Data to evaluate NFL decision making was gathered by using the nflreadr package [@nflverse]. The creators of this package provide detailed instructions and examples on how to use and clean this data, which can be found at their website [here](https://nflreadr.nflverse.com/).

```{r}
library(nflverse)

raw_data <- load_4th_pbp(2022)
```

```{r}
save(raw_data, file = "raw_nfl.Rdata")
```
