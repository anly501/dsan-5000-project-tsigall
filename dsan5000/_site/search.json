    "text": "As we saw in the last step of our EDA, coaches are consistently far too conservative when it comes to fourth down decisions. We are trying to figure out why this may be the case. Two possible reasons immediately come to mind:\n\n4th down decisions have less effect on the outcome of games than we think.\nCoaches who are more conservative will keep their jobs longer, as being aggressive (and failing) on fourth down could be generally frowned upon by the NFL community.\n\nLets explore the first reason. One simple measure of coach success season by season is winning percentage. To take a quick look this, we can look at how correct decision rate on 4th down compares to the winning percentage a coach had in that particular season. Alongside this process we will also look at the average EPA per play on 4th downs coaches had in go-for-it situations that season. EPA is a measure of success that stands for “Estimated Points Added” and it measures the estimated points a play will add to the total final score at the end of the game.\n\n\n\n\n\ncoach\nteam\nseason\ncorrect_rate\npct\nepa\n\n\n\n\nAdam Gase\nMIA\n2016\n0.075\n0.625\n-0.278\n\n\nAdam Gase\nMIA\n2017\n0.375\n0.375\n-0.133\n\n\nAdam Gase\nMIA\n2018\n0.211\n0.438\n-0.021\n\n\nAdam Gase\nNYJ\n2019\n0.340\n0.438\n-0.171\n\n\nAdam Gase\nNYJ\n2020\n0.237\n0.125\n-0.382\n\n\nAndy Reid\nKC\n2016\n0.269\n0.750\n0.230\n\n\nAndy Reid\nKC\n2017\n0.170\n0.625\n0.096\n\n\nAndy Reid\nKC\n2018\n0.422\n0.750\n0.353\n\n\nAndy Reid\nKC\n2019\n0.286\n0.750\n0.021\n\n\nAndy Reid\nKC\n2020\n0.360\n0.875\n0.097\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have the winning percentage and epa alongside the correct decision rate on fourth down for every coach by season. Let’s take a closer look at this table and add averages for winning percentage, correct decision rate, and epa.\n\n\n\n\n\ncoach\nteam\nseason\ncorrect_rate\npct\nepa\nz_wins\nz_correct\nz_epa\nabove_mean_wins\nabove_mean_correct\nabove_mean_epa\n\n\n\n\nAdam Gase\nMIA\n2016\n0.075\n0.625\n-0.278\n0.657\n-2.428\n-1.450\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nAdam Gase\nMIA\n2017\n0.375\n0.375\n-0.133\n-0.653\n0.567\n-0.613\n0\n1\n0\n\n\nAdam Gase\nMIA\n2018\n0.211\n0.438\n-0.021\n-0.326\n-1.075\n0.032\n0\n0\n1\n\n\nAdam Gase\nNYJ\n2019\n0.340\n0.438\n-0.171\n-0.326\n0.218\n-0.837\n0\n1\n0\n\n\nAdam Gase\nNYJ\n2020\n0.237\n0.125\n-0.382\n-1.963\n-0.808\n-2.054\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nAndy Reid\nKC\n2016\n0.269\n0.750\n0.230\n1.312\n-0.489\n1.482\n1\n0\n1\n\n\nAndy Reid\nKC\n2017\n0.170\n0.625\n0.096\n0.657\n-1.481\n0.705\n1\n0\n1\n\n\nAndy Reid\nKC\n2018\n0.422\n0.750\n0.353\n1.312\n1.039\n2.189\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nAndy Reid\nKC\n2019\n0.286\n0.750\n0.021\n1.312\n-0.324\n0.274\n1\n0\n1\n\n\nAndy Reid\nKC\n2020\n0.360\n0.875\n0.097\n1.967\n0.417\n0.710\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can cross tabulate effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks as if decision rate on 4th down has little effect on the win rate of coaches, which makes sense as when looking at plays across an entire game, 4th down plays make up a small percentage of those plays. It would be worth looking at how influential 4th down plays are on the result of each game compared to other types of plays, though.\nHaving a good correct 4th down decision does seem to have more of an effect on EPA, however. This makes sense as EPA in this case is estimated points added on 4th down, meaning this metric is directly measuring success on 4th down only, rather than success across an entire game. It is not surpising that having a good correct 4th down decision rate would lead to a more positive 4th down success metric than a whole game success metric.\nIt is an encouraging sign to see that making “correct” decisions on 4th down leads to more points on those 4th down plays. This means it would be useful to explore how 4th down plays contribute to a team’s final score compared to plays on other downs. This may give us a better idea as to how these 4th down decisions affect the success of coaches across the entire game, rather than simply on 4th down."

    "text": "Thomas Sigall - tns29\n\n\nDecision Making in Sports\nIn sports, as in all areas of life, there are a variety of decisions that actors can make as their game or competition unfolds. As a result, there are numerous decisions that can be made, each coming with their own level of risk. Some decisions are obvious, like tagging up from third base on a deep fly ball with less than two outs or punting on fourth and long when back at your own end zone. However, many more appear to not be so obvious, as evidenced by the variety of opinions that arise when observing these choices in action. Despite numerous advancements in analysis in many sports, decisions are still heavily debated on a daily basis. Even if analysis on other similar situations suggests one decision should be made, we often see the exact opposite on the field. Ward Edwards, in his 1954 paper “The theory of decision making” introduces this well, saying “The traditional mathematical notion for dealing with games of chance (and so with risky decisions) is the notion that choices should be made so as to maximize expected value… The assumption that people actually behave the way this mathematical notion says they should is contradicted by observable behavior in many risky situations” (Edwards 1954, 391).\nWhy do people behave this way? It goes against what we know about expected value and suggests that we are illogical actors. This is elaborated further by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in their influential 1979 paper “Prospect Theory: an Analysis of Decision Under Risk” in which they explain, “Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory” (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). This eventually leads them to an alternative theory of choice “in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights” (Kahneman and Tversky 1979).\nTo better understand decision making, we will do as David Romer did in his 2006 paper “Do Firms Maximize? Evidence from Professional Football” (Romer 2006). We will look at one of the most decisions certainly in football but perhaps in all of sports: 4th down. Focusing on this decision and attempting to understand the reasoning behind why it is so frequently done incorrectly will hopefully allow us to learn more about the decision making process not only in football, but in many other areas of life.\n\n\nQuestions\n\nHow are decisions in sports currently evaluated?\nCould we improve this evaluation process?\nWould improvements in this process lead to better decision making on the field?\nHow can we determine why certain decisions are made?\nHow can we apply alternative theories of choice to specific games?\nHow different would the sports landscape look if everything were optimized?\nAre there certain factors that theories of choice could not take into account?\nIf there truly is an optimal choice every time, would it be possible for anyone to coach a team?\nCan these principles be exteneded to off-field deicisons, such as team-building and player evaluation?\nAre unoptimized decisions part of what makes sports enjoyable?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nEdwards, Ward. 1954. “The Theory of Decision Making.” Psychological Bulletin 51 (4): 380–417. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0053870.\n\n\nKahneman, Daniel, and Amos Tversky. 1979. “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk.” Econometrica 47 (2): 263. https://doi.org/10.2307/1914185.\n\n\nRomer, David. 2006. “Do Firms Maximize?

    "title": "4th Down Decisions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "We will initially explore the data in a similar manner to the method seen in David Romer’s paper (Romer 2006). In his evaluation of fourth down decisions, he followed a four step process. First, he estimated the value of kicking (not going for it). Second, he estimated the value of going for it. Third, he figured out which decision was better. Finally, he compared this to the actual decisions made by coaches.\nThanks again to the nflverse package, we already have completed steps one and two as we can simply use the go_boost variable to estimate the value of kicking or going for it on each fourth down. Step three was already completed in the cleaning process, as we already have a table that takes into account the fact that if go_boost is negative, then the offensive team should kick. If go_boost is positive, then they should go for it. We have all the information to evaluate theoretical decisions, now we must evaluate the actual decisions made by coaches.\n\n4th Down Statistics\nHow often do coaches make the correct decision on 4th down?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see a clear difference between these two plots when they are put on the same scale. When it would be a “correct” decision to kick rather than go for it (when win probability would go down if a conversion was attempted) coaches often make the correct decision. Every coach was correct in these situations at least 90% which makes sense because these decisions are often easy to make. They are not the borderline decisions that we can learn a lot about coaches from. For those we turn to the first graph, where we can clearly see that the decision on whether or not to go for it when doing so would increase your win probability is much more difficult, as only two coaches got this one right over 50% of the time. Let’s look at this decision more closely and see what turns coaches away from going for it even when they should be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first graph is colored based on the proportion of plays in which a coach decides to go for it when doing so would have a positive impact on their win probability. The second graph is colored based on the proportion of plays in which going for it would have a positive impact on their win probability, regardless of whether or not a coach actually decided to go for it.\nThese graphs clearly show that coaches in the NFL are far too conservative. The only situation in which they consistently go for it is on 4th and 1 inside the 50. The data suggest that they should actually always go for it when there are less than 2 yards to go and almost always go for it within 5 yards. Coaches are consistently far too conservative in situations when it is clearly advantageous to attempt a 4th down conversion. Why might this be the case? Let’s perform some EDA to come up with some possible explanations.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nRomer, David. 2006. “Do Firms Maximize?
