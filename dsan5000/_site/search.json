As a result, there are numerous decisions that can be made, each coming with their own level of risk. Some decisions are obvious, like tagging up from third base on a deep fly ball with less than two outs or punting on fourth and long when back at your own end zone. However, many more appear to not be so obvious, as evidenced by the variety of opinions that arise when observing these choices in action. Despite numerous advancements in analysis in many sports, decisions are still heavily debated on a daily basis. Even if analysis on other similar situations suggests one decision should be made, we often see the exact opposite on the field. Ward Edwards, in his 1954 paper “The theory of decision making” introduces this well, saying “The traditional mathematical notion for dealing with games of chance (and so with risky decisions) is the notion that choices should be made so as to maximize expected value… The assumption that people actually behave the way this mathematical notion says they should is contradicted by observable behavior in many risky situations” (Edwards 1954, 391).\nWhy do people behave this way? It goes against what we know about expected value and suggests that we are illogical actors. This is elaborated further by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in their influential 1979 paper “Prospect Theory: an Analysis of Decision Under Risk” in which they explain, “Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory” (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). This eventually leads them to an alternative theory of choice “in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights” (Kahneman and Tversky 1979).\nTo better understand decision making, we will do as David Romer did in his 2006 paper “Do Firms Maximize? Evidence from Professional Football” (Romer 2006). We will look at one of the most decisions certainly in football but perhaps in all of sports: 4th down. Focusing on this decision and attempting to understand the reasoning behind why it is so frequently done incorrectly will hopefully allow us to learn more about the decision making process not only in football, but in many other areas of life.\n\n\nQuestions\n\nHow are decisions in sports currently evaluated?\nCould we improve this evaluation process?\nWould improvements in this process lead to better decision making on the field?\nHow can we determine why certain decisions are made?\nHow can we apply alternative theories of choice to specific games?\nHow different would the sports landscape look if everything were optimized?\nAre there certain factors that theories of choice could not take into account?\nIf there truly is an optimal choice every time, would it be possible for anyone to coach a team?\nCan these principles be exteneded to off-field deicisons, such as team-building and player evaluation?\nAre unoptimized decisions part of what makes sports enjoyable?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nEdwards, Ward. 1954. “The Theory of Decision Making.” Psychological Bulletin 51 (4): 380–417. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0053870.\n\n\nKahneman, Daniel, and Amos Tversky. 1979. “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk.” Econometrica 47 (2): 263. https://doi.org/10.2307/1914185.\n\n\nRomer, David. 2006. “Do Firms Maximize?

Looking at this more closely requires a table that shows coaches decisions based on where they are on the field and how many downs they need to gain to get a first down.\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'yardline_100'.

The first row, for example, shows that 80.5% of the time a coach decided to go for it when they were at 4th and 1 at the 1 yard line - they were 1 yard away from scoring. It also shows is the average increase in win probability if a coach were to go for it. For example, at 4th and 1 at the 1 yard line, going for it increases your win probability by an average of 7%, an incredibly large number.\n\n\n\n\nThe NFL subreddit is a useful place to extract text data produced by fans and their reaction to these essential decisions. Like most jobs, the goal of an NFL head coach is not only to win games, but to keep their bosses happy. The size and outspoken nature of NFL fan bases can be a factor in the job security of these coaches, as if a coach loses the fans, their job gets a lot harder. This is where sentiment analysis comes in, as getting an idea of how fans feel about 4th down decisions by certain coaches may give us insights into how they are making their decisions, and whether or not the fans have any influence on the decision making process.\nThis allows us to get posts from the NFL subreddit using a search query of “4th down” and access the comments of those posts.\n\nsubreddit = reddit.subreddit(\"nfl\")\nquery = \"4th down\"\n\ntop_posts = subreddit.search(query, limit=100)\nurls = []\ncorpus = []\n\nfor post in top_posts:\n    urls.append(post.permalink)\n    \nurl = \"https://www.reddit.com\" + urls[0]\n\nsubmission = reddit.submission(url=url)\n\nsubmission.comments.replace_more(limit=0)\n\n[]\n\nfor top_level_comment in submission.comments:\n    corpus.append(top_level_comment.body)\n\nvectorizer=CountVectorizer()\nXs = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)\n\ncol_names=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\n\nThe overall sentiment from this brief analysis is a positive one, but the search terms need to be more specific to get any useful information out of this process.\n\nfrom nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n\noverall = []\nsia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\n\nfor text in corpus:\n  score=sia.polarity_scores(text)\n  overall.append(score['compound'])\n\n\n\nsum(overall)/len(overall)\n\n0.1513641304347826"

    "text": "We will initially explore the data in a similar manner to the method seen in David Romer’s paper (Romer 2006). In his evaluation of fourth down decisions, he followed a four step process. First, he estimated the value of kicking (not going for it). Second, he estimated the value of going for it. Third, he figured out which decision was better. Finally, he compared this to the actual decisions made by coaches.\nThanks again to the nflverse package, we already have completed steps one and two as we can simply use the go_boost variable to estimate the value of kicking or going for it on each fourth down. Step three was already completed in the cleaning process, as we already have a table that takes into account the fact that if go_boost is negative, then the offensive team should kick. If go_boost is positive, then they should go for it. We have all the information to evaluate theoretical decisions, now we must evaluate the actual decisions made by coaches.\n\n4th Down Statistics\nHow often do coaches make the correct decision on 4th down?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see a clear difference between these two plots when they are put on the same scale. When it would be a “correct” decision to kick rather than go for it (when win probability would go down if a conversion was attempted) coaches often make the correct decision. Every coach was correct in these situations at least 90% which makes sense because these decisions are often easy to make. They are not the borderline decisions that we can learn a lot about coaches from. For those we turn to the first graph, where we can clearly see that the decision on whether or not to go for it when doing so would increase your win probability is much more difficult, as only two coaches got this one right over 50% of the time. Let’s look at this decision more closely and see what turns coaches away from going for it even when they should be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first graph is colored based on the proportion of plays in which a coach decides to go for it when doing so would have a positive impact on their win probability. The second graph is colored based on the proportion of plays in which going for it would have a positive impact on their win probability, regardless of whether or not a coach actually decided to go for it.\nThese graphs clearly show that coaches in the NFL are far too conservative. The only situation in which they consistently go for it is on 4th and 1 inside the 50. The data suggest that they should actually always go for it when there are less than 2 yards to go and almost always go for it within 5 yards. Coaches are consistently far too conservative in situations when it is clearly advantageous to attempt a 4th down conversion. Why might this be the case? Let’s perform some EDA to come up with some possible explanations.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nRomer, David. 2006. “Do Firms Maximize?

To do this we only need to look at these columns:\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 9\n  home_coach away_coach posteam_type ydstogo yardline_100 posteam go_boost    go\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Robert Sa… John Harb… home              15           64 NYJ       -3.45      0\n2 Robert Sa… John Harb… away               1           51 BAL        3.67      0\n3 Robert Sa… John Harb… home               9           82 NYJ       -2.07      0\n4 Robert Sa… John Harb… away               9           65 BAL       -1.01      0\n5 Robert Sa… John Harb… away               3            6 BAL        0.141     0\n6 Robert Sa… John Harb… home               1           66 NYJ        0.654     0\n# ℹ 1 more variable: epa &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nEach unit in this table is one 4th down decision.

This is made easy by the inclusion of the go_boost variable, which tells us the change in win probability if the team decides to go for it.\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  coach          should_go shouldnt_go      EPA count\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 Andy Reid          0.216       0.982  0.0590    106\n2 Arthur Smith       0.333       0.985 -0.0540    114\n3 Bill Belichick     0.204       0.962 -0.221     128\n4 Brandon Staley     0.347       0.971 -0.00908   140\n5 Brian Daboll       0.361       0.949  0.159     139\n6 Dan Campbell       0.507       0.907 -0.00432   121\n\n\nThis data shows when coaches make the correct choice on 4th down, their average estimated points added on 4th downs throughout the season, and the number of 4th down decisions they had to make throughout the season. It shows the percent of times each coach makes the correct decision in two scenarios: when going for it would have a positive effect on their win probability and when going for it would have a negative effect on their win probability.\n\n\n\nOne of, if not the most important factor in making a decision on fourth down is the position your team is on the field. Looking at this more closely requires a table that shows coaches decisions based on where they are on the field and how many downs they need to gain to get a first down.\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'yardline_100'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n# Groups:   yardline_100 [3]\n  yardline_100 ydstogo    go count go_boost increase_odds\n         &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1            1       1  80.5    41    7.06              1\n2            2       1  75       4    3.69              1\n3            2       2  40.7    27    2.89              1\n4            3       1  50       2    2.54              1\n5            3       2  16.7     6    0.995             1\n6            3       3  38.5    26    0.721             1\n\n\nThis table shows us the percentage of times a coach chose to go for it in the given situation. The first row, for example, shows that 80.5% of the time a coach decided to go for it when they were at 4th and 1 at the 1 yard line - they were 1 yard away from scoring. It also shows is the average increase in win probability if a coach were to go for it. For example, at 4th and 1 at the 1 yard line, going for it increases your win probability by an average of 7%, an incredibly large number."
