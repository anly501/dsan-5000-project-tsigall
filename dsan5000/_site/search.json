As a result, there are numerous decisions that can be made, each coming with their own level of risk. Some decisions are obvious, like tagging up from third base on a deep fly ball with less than two outs or punting on fourth and long when back at your own end zone. However, many more appear to not be so obvious, as evidenced by the variety of opinions that arise when observing these choices in action. Despite numerous advancements in analysis in many sports, decisions are still heavily debated on a daily basis. Even if analysis on other similar situations suggests one decision should be made, we often see the exact opposite on the field. Ward Edwards, in his 1954 paper “The theory of decision making” introduces this well, saying “The traditional mathematical notion for dealing with games of chance (and so with risky decisions) is the notion that choices should be made so as to maximize expected value… The assumption that people actually behave the way this mathematical notion says they should is contradicted by observable behavior in many risky situations” (Edwards 1954, 391).\nWhy do people behave this way? It goes against what we know about expected value and suggests that we are illogical actors. This is elaborated further by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in their influential 1979 paper “Prospect Theory: an Analysis of Decision Under Risk” in which they explain, “Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory” (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). This eventually leads them to an alternative theory of choice “in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights” (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). Looking at a variety of sports through these alternative theories of choice could help to explain some inconsistent decisions that we see while we watch our favorite teams.\n\n\nQuestions\n\nHow are decisions in sports currently evaluated?\nCould we improve this evaluation process?\nWould improvements in this process lead to better decision making on the field?\nHow can we determine why certain decisions are made?\nHow can we apply alternative theories of choice to specific games?\nHow different would the sports landscape look if everything were optimized?\nAre there certain factors that theories of choice could not take into account?\nIf there truly is an optimal choice every time, would it be possible for anyone to coach a team?\nCan these principles be exteneded to off-field deicisons, such as team-building and player evaluation?\nAre unoptimized decisions part of what makes sports enjoyable?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nEdwards, Ward. 1954. “The Theory of Decision Making.” Psychological Bulletin 51 (4): 380–417. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0053870.\n\n\nKahneman, Daniel, and Amos Tversky. 1979. “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk.” Econometrica 47 (2): 263. https://doi.org/10.2307/1914185."
